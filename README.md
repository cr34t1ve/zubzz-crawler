# zubzz-crawler
My first rust app, a web crawler, to go through www.zubzz.com/recommendations and return the restaurants sorted by category

# What this is
A rust app (my very first try at rust), a web crawler, that goes through www.zubzz.com/recommendations to get all restaurants listed on there, categorised by type of recommendation, ie, Breakfast, Lunch, etc.

# Why I built this
I was home alone and very hungry and wanted to get something to eat and I was down to try something random as I was getting too used to the food around me so I decided to check zubzz.com but then there's so much information that makes it hard to make the decision. And so, I thought to build an app that would get me the restaurants categorised so I can make my decision at random, without all the extra information.

# Why Rust?
I've always been wanting to try Rust but I never really had the push to. I thought to use js to build this but then I thought to myself, If I am going to be building an app that is going to run through an entire webpage and spit out some info then performance is definitely key here. And so I decided to go with Rust!
